            Chinese society greatly valued gastronomy, and developed an extensive study of the subject based on its traditional medical beliefs. Chinese culture initially centered around the North China Plain. The first domesticated crops seem to have been the foxtail
            and broomcorn varieties of millet, while rice was cultivated in the south. By 2000 BC, wheat had arrived from western Asia. These grains were, typically served as warm noodle soups, however, instead of baked into bread as in Europe. Nobles
            hunted various wild game and consumed mutton, pork, dog, and beef as these animals were domesticated. Grain was stored against famine and flood and meat was preserved with salt, vinegar, curing, and fermenting. The flavor of the meat was enhanced
            by cooking it in animal fats though this practice was mostly restricted to the wealthy.[7]<br /><br />By the time of Confucius in the late Zhou, gastronomy has become a high art. He was recorded discussing about the principles
            of dining: "The rice would never be too white, the meat would never be too finely cut... When it was not cooked right, man would not eat. When it was cooked bad, man would not eat. When the meat was not cut properly, man would not eat. When
            the food was not prepared with the right sauce, man would not eat. Although there are plenty of meats, they should not be cooked more than staple food. There is no limit for alcohol, before a man gets drunk." [8] During Shi Huangdi's Qin dynasty,
            the empire expanded into the south. By the time of the Han Dynasty, the different regions and cuisines of China's people were linked by major canals and leading to a greater complexity in the different regional cuisines. Not only is food seen
            as giving "qi", energy, but food is also about maintaining yin and yang.[9] The philosophy behind it was rooted in the I Ching and Chinese traditional medicine: food was judged for color, aroma, taste, and texture and a good meal was expected
            to balance the Four Natures ('hot', warm, cool, and 'cold') and the Five Tastes (pungent, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty). Salt was used as a preservative from early times, but in cooking was added in the form of soy sauce, and not at the
            table.[10] The predominance of chopsticks and spoons as eating utensils also necessitated that most food be prepared in bite-sized pieces or (as with fish) be so tender that it could be easily picked apart.<br /><br />By the Later Han period
            (2nd century), writers[who?] frequently complained of lazy aristocrats who did nothing but sit around all day eating smoked meats and roasts.<br /><br />During the Han dynasty, the Chinese developed methods of food preservation for military
            rations during campaigns such as drying meat into jerky and cooking, roasting, and drying grain.[11] Chinese legends claim that the roasted, flat bread shaobing was brought back from the Xiyu (the Western Regions, a name for Central Asia)
            by the Han dynasty General Ban Chao, and that it was originally known as hubing (胡餅, lit. "barbarian bread"). The shaobing is believed to be descended from the hubing.[12] Shaobing is believed to be related to the Persian and Central Asian
            naan and the Near Eastern pita.[13][14][15][16] Foreign westerners made and sold sesame cakes in China during the Tang dynasty.[17]<br /><br />During the Southern and Northern Dynasties non-Han people like the Xianbei of Northern Wei introduced
            their cuisine to northern China, and these influences continued up to the Tang dynasty, popularizing meat like mutton and dairy products like goat milk, yogurts, and Kumis among even Han people. It was during the Song dynasty that Han Chinese
            developed an aversion to dairy products and abandoned the dairy foods introduced earlier.[18]
